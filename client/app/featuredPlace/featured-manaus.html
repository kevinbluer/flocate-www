			<p>"Manaus (Portuguese pronunciation: [mɐˈnaws] or [mɐˈnawʃ]), or Manáos before 1939, or (formerly) Lugar de Barra do Rio Negro, is the capital city of the state of Amazonas in northern Brazil. It is situated at the confluence of the Negro and Solimões rivers. With a population of two million, it is the most populous city of Amazonas,[1] and also the most populous city of the Amazon rainforest." <strong><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manaus" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a></strong></p>
			<p>The last line above is important as this city is literally part of the Amazon rainforest!</p>
